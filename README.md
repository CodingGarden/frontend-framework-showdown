# Build an Image Search App with:
## Vanilla JS, React.js, Angular 6 and Vue.js

All apps will contact the 500px Image Search API.

`https://api.500px.com/v1/photos/search?term=flowers`

> 500px appears to have disabled consumer keys!! Try another image search API like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers)

> You will need a consumer key from 500px.com. Update `your-api-key-here` with your consumer key to use the app. After signing up, create an application here: https://500px.com/settings/applications

All apps will use the skeleton CSS framework:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/skeleton/2.0.4/skeleton.min.css">
```

And use this body style:

```css
body {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 2em auto 0 auto;
}
```
